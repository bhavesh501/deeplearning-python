Once 1 
upon 1 
a 7 
time 1 
there 1 
were 2 
three 1

who 1 
lived 1 
together 1 
in 2 
a 7 
house 2 
of 2 
their 2 
own 1 
in 2 
a 7 
wood 2 
One 2 
of 2 
them 1 
was 4 
a 7 
little 3 
small 1 
wee 1 
bear; 1 
one 1 
was 4 
a 7 
middle-sized 1 
bear 2 
and 2 
the 4 
other 1 
was 4 
a 7 
great 1 
huge 1

One 2 
day 1 
after 1 
they 3 
had 2 
made 1 
porridge 2 
for 1 
their 2 
breakfast 1 
they 3 
walked 1 
out 1 
into 2 
the 4 
wood 2 
while 2 
the 4 
porridge 2 
was 4 
cooling 1 
And 1 
while 2 
they 3 
were 2 
walking 1 
a 7

This 1

that 1 
tumbled 1 
down 1 
her 3

to 1 
her 3

and 2 
everyone 1
